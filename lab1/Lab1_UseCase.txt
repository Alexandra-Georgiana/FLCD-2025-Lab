Document use case
This mini language is designed for mathematical and computational problems, offering 9 essential statements.

1. Variable Declaration: Create and initialize a named variable.
Variables store intermediate results and make formulas readable and reusable.
They prevent recalculation and enable step-by-step problem solving.
var radius = 5;
var pi = 3.14159;
var area = pi * radius * radius;

2. Assignment: Update an existing variable with a new value.
Allows cumulative operations (totals, counters, balances).
Without assignment, iterative updates wouldn’t be possible.
total = total + price;
counter = counter + 1;

3. Print: Display the value of an expression.
Output is required for user interaction and debugging.
print "Area = ";
print area;

4. Input: Read a user-provided value into a variable.
Makes programs interactive and adaptable to new inputs.
input radius;
input height;

5. Expression Statement: Evaluate an expression without storing the result.
Useful for function calls or tests where no variable assignment is required.
sqrt(25);
abs(-10);

6. If/Else: Execute statements conditionally based on boolean expressions.
Implements decision-making and conditional calculations.
if (grade >= 90) {
    print "A";
} else {
    print "B";
}

7. While: Repeat statements while a condition holds true.
Allows repetitive computations such as summations, loops, and iterative methods.
var i = 1;
var sum = 0;
while (i <= 10) {
    sum = sum + i;
    i = i + 1;
}




8. Function Definition: Define reusable computations with parameters and return values.
Encapsulates reusable formulas and simplifies complex calculations.
function circle_area(r) {
    var pi = 3.14159;
    return pi * r * r;
}

9. Return: Return a value from a function.
Enables functions to produce results that can be used elsewhere, allowing modular, reusable computations.
function circle_area(r) {
    var pi = 3.14159;
    return pi * r * r;
}
